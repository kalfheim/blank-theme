# Blank

Just a blank scaffold theme for the [October CMS](https://github.com/octobercms/october).

## Installation
(not yet implemented)

`php artisan theme:install krisawzm.blank <theme-dir>`

Replace `<theme-dir>` with whatever fits the project you're building.

## Activate the theme
(not yet implemented)

`php artisan theme:use <name>`

Where `<name>` is whatever you specified in `theme:install`.

## After installing
### This scaffold includes two asset files:
- `assets/css/app.css`
- `assets/js/app.js`

You can either continue building on them or delete them - it's your choice.

This scaffold also includes the `@jquery`, `@framework` and `@framework.extras` JS assets in `layouts/default.htm` which can be removed unless you're planning on using them.

### Theme preview image
The `assets/images/theme-preview.png` file should either be deleted or replaced with a screenshot of your theme, as per the [documentation](https://octobercms.com/docs/themes/development#preview-image).
